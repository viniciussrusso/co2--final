**Step 1**
- Scroll down the page until you see 8 boxes [Electricity, Gas, Car, Motorcycle, Train, Subway, Bus, Ferry]
- Insert the value representing each monthly consumption for each of those boxes
- Once you inset any value you should be able to see the Total CO2/kg, this is you month's results. 

**Step 2**
- We understand that it can be difficult to understand the total CO2/kg. Therefore, we have added a green area that is showing you Feedback. 
- You must click on the Get Feedback button, after finished with Step 1. 
- You are now able to check your results in a simpler form. 

**Step 3**
- This step is where you can place donations to help our planet.
